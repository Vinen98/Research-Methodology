## Name of my project:
Android Malware Detection and Categorization


## Description of your project:
- Android has become the leading operating system for next-generation smart devices. Its market shares as of 2020 is 84.8% Consequently, the number of Android malware has also skyrocketed. 
- Malware is one of the most serious security threats today.
- With the increasing significance of malware attacks, much research has concentrated on developing techniques to collect, study, and mitigate malicious code. Our goal is to add all related work in this domain, categorise it and give a summary of different approaches for malware detection on android devices.
- In this paper we aim to analyse the malware
and categorize the different malware detection
approaches and methods. We also discuss on the
possible future trends or the more efficient techniques that can be used in the future for malware
detection.

## Road-map (future ideas):

- Investment in advanced artificial
intelligence techniques such as machine learning
and big data technology should be explored for
future initiatives. 
- Furthermore, to better solve malware family identification issues, crowdsourcing
and automated detection should be used. No technique, however, can detect all malware in the
field.Thus malware detection is also considered as
a NP-complete problem.

## Authors / Acknowledgements:

- Part of this work was done for my research work which is based malware detection and classification techniques. I want to thank all the authors for which I have taken the resources to gather the information regarding this topic, and my professor for guiding throughout the term.

## Project Status:

- I am very much deep into this project and I will be continuing this project in future as well.
